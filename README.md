## Question 1) Define the following unit, integration, regression tests and when you would use each?
- Unit test: To test an isolated unit of code and verify its functionality. This is used to ensure that a unit of code does its expected behavior.
- Integration test: To test if a piece of code works well with other pieces of code. This is used to ensure that a piece of code does not cause unexpected behavior while being used in conjunction with its environment. 
- Regression test: Testing new changes with an old test suite to verrify that the new changes did not cause new issues. 

## Question 2) Briefly explain pytest discovery (file/function naming) and what a fixture is.
- pytest recommends appending test before or after a testing file's name. For functions, pytest recommends prefixing 'test' to function and method names. 
- A fixture provides the context/data to a test.

## Features used: 
- pytest.mark.parametrize
